#### **Recommendations:**

1. **Increase Occupancy Rates**:  
   With an overall occupancy rate of 57.8%, there's room for improvement, particularly in properties with lower occupancy. Marketing campaigns and discounts during off-peak times could help boost these numbers.

2. **Optimize Cancellation Policies**:  
   High cancellation percentages (up to 26.4% in some cases) suggest the need for more stringent cancellation policies, such as reduced flexibility closer to the booking date.

3. **Improve Guest Experience**:  
   With an average customer rating of 3.62, focusing on enhancing the guest experience through service improvements and more personalized offerings could help drive repeat business and increase overall ratings.

4. **Target Business Customers**:  
   Since 61.65% of the revenue comes from business travelers, focusing efforts on business-friendly services (like faster Wi-Fi, meeting rooms, and corporate discounts) could further enhance revenue from this segment.
